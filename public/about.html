<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Farah. I love learning web development and building cool websites. I'm always curious and enjoy solving problems using code.</p>

<p>In my free time, I read about technology, practice coding, and watch tutorials to improve my skills. My goal is to become a great full-stack developer one day.</p>
